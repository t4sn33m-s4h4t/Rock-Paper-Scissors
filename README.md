	<h1>Rock Paper Scissors Game</h1>
	<p>This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>To play the game, simply click on one of the three buttons to choose your move. The computer will then randomly select its move, and the winner will be determined based on the classic Rock Paper Scissors rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
	<li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
	<li>Paper beats Rock</li>
</ul>

<p>If you win, your score will increase by 1. If the computer wins, its score will increase by 1. If it's a tie, neither score will change. The game ends when one player reaches a score of 5.</p>
